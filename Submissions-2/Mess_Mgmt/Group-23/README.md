Mess Management System
----------------------
Project developed in partial fulfilment of the requirements of CS F213 - Object Oriented Programming
This software system will be a mess management system which consists of two separate softwares, one to be used by the students who eat in the mess and one for the mess administrator. The student software allows students to login and choose the monthly mess option, place orders for the night canteen online, book the mess for special occasions, view the daily mess menu and the night canteen (NC) menu, view food consumption statistics, inform the mess authorities when he/she won't be eating in the mess and submit feedback. The admin software will allow the mess administrator to make changes to the daily mess menu, upload food consumption statistics and view net profit, view orders for the night mess and approve any special lunch orders as well along with reading feedback. The system will utilize a relational database for handling all the data such as menu items, prices, student IDs, consumption statistics, student feedback, etc.
Further information on this software can be found in the SRS doc on the repo.
